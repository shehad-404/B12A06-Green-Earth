## Q&A

### 1. Difference between var, let, and const
- **var**: Function-scoped, allows re-declaration, hoisted with undefined.
- **let**: Block-scoped, cannot be re-declared, hoisted but not initialized.
- **const**: Block-scoped, cannot be re-declared or reassigned, hoisted but not initialized.

### 2. Difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()
- **map()**: Returns a new array with transformed elements.
- **forEach()**: Iterates over array elements but returns undefined.
- **filter()**: Returns a new array with elements passing a condition.

### 3. Arrow functions in ES6
Shorter syntax for writing functions:  
```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
